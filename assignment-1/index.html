            <p>“Past Lives” is a dreamy, nostalgic song that leans into the feeling of déjà vu in love—the sense that you've known someone forever, even when you haven't. Its hazy production and gentle buildup give it an almost timeless quality, making it feel both intimate and expansive. The lyrics focus on emotional connection rather than a literal story, which is part of why the song resonates so strongly with listeners.</p>

            <p>The artist behind the song, BØRNS, is known for blending indie pop with a retro, psychedelic edge. His music often feels cinematic and romantic, pairing airy vocals with lush instrumentation. With “Past Lives,” BØRNS captured the kind of longing and wonder that defines much of his work, helping cement the song as one of his most recognizable tracks.</p>
